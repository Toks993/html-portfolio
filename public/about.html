<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Temitope Eden Peters. An administrator at AltSchool 
  and I really want to learn about front end engineering.</p>

<p>I have a dream to build a virtual shopping mall where you can have a real life 
  like experience of shopping without leaving your home. 
  You can create an avater that mimicks you shopping from aisle to aisle as you would do if you were physically in the shop.</p>
